<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

<p><em>The Wandering Earth</em> (流浪地球) is a 2019 Chinese science fiction film directed by a Beijing Film Academy alum, Frant Gwo (郭帆). The film is considered to be China&#8217;s first sci-fi blockbuster and received a wide range of popularity both domestically and internationally (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/iclahd-21/125964772" target="_blank">M. Zhang 228</a>). It is also the fifth highest grossing non-English film to date, grossing over $700 million worldwide (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wandering_Earth" target="_blank">“The Wandering Earth”</a>). However, although it has a futuristic setting filled with advanced technology and stunning visual effects, The Wandering Earth reinforces Chinese traditional family values and collectivist culture, which contributes to Chinese nationalism and serves the interests of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p>



<p>Despite the apocalyptic background, the film highlights the protagonist’s strained relationship with his father and their gradual reconciliation over the course of the film. This father-son story, along with the film’s emphasis on the concept of homecoming and the flattening of female characters, is representative of China’s deep-rooted Confucian family values which underlines patriarchal authority. </p>

<p>The film also conveys the idea of a united humanity through the depictions of people all around the world coming together in crisis and the de-emphasis of individual heroism. This global level of collectivism is reflective of the notion of the “Great Unity” (大同) in Chinese classical philosophy, which aligns with CCP’s contemporary political ideology of the “community of common destiny for mankind” (人类命运共同体). This essay focuses on analyzing how the father-son relationship is an analogy of the ideal relationship between the individual and the state and how China’s leadership in the world’s collective effort to save humanity is reflective of the CCP’s ambition to achieve the Chinese Dream (中国梦). Therefore, while many deem the film as having a “strong Hollywood genre style” given the film’s futuristic aesthetics, pompous soundtrack, and melodramatic plot (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-85580-2_6" target="_blank">de Kloet 156</a>), its core ideas are deeply rooted in Chinese traditional values, consolidating the government’s authority and arousing nationalist spirits among Chinese audiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>PLOT </strong></p>



<div class="is-layout-flex wp-container-6 wp-block-columns">
<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>The story is based on the novel, <em>The Wandering Earth</em>, by Liu Cixin (刘慈欣). It is set in the near future with the premise that the Sun is expanding and will soon engulf the Earth. In order to maximize the surviving population and save human civilization from this catastrophe, the United Earth Government (UEG) is formed and decides to propel the Earth out of the solar system and into a new, habitable solar system located 4.2 light years away. Utilizing all resources, humans build 10,000 Earth engines and 2,000 Torque engines on the planet’s surface and the Navigation Platform International Space Station (NPISS) to help navigate the Earth along its journey. Each engine has one underground city beneath it to shelter the remaining population from the continuously deteriorating environment. The movie focuses on the part of the space voyage where humans try to use Jupiter&#8217;s gravity to assist with the final acceleration out of the solar system. Due to Jupiter’s gravitational spike, earthquakes tear up the ground and a lot of the engines lose power. The plot revolves around the protagonist, Liu Qi, and his family’s effort to restart the engines and prevent the Earth from colliding with Jupiter.</p>

<p><strong>FATHER-SON AND INDIVIDUAL-STATE RELATIONS</strong></p>



<p>Apart from the grandiose world-saving story, <em>The Wandering Earth</em> concentrates on the ambivalent relationship between Liu Qi and his father, Liu Peiqiang, which eventually “cement the authority of the father” (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/9/3/94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhu 2</a>). The film uses a lot of flashbacks from Liu Qi’s childhood to gradually unveil the conflicts between him and his father. The frequent uses of flashbacks also add a lot of sentimentality to the film and make the film seem like a family melodrama as flashbacks are predominant in psychological melodrama (<a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9780203075555/cinema-studies-key-concepts-susan-hayward" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hayward 161</a>). Because Liu Peiqiang gives up on the medical treatment of his wife in exchange for Liu Qi and Han Ziang’s slots to live in the underground refuge and disappears from the family life for seventeen years for work, his son becomes resentful towards his “autocracy” and long absence. However, the audience can later find out that Liu Qi does not really hate his father; he simply misses him and seeks for his guidance when he feels helpless. Liu Qi’s constant recollections of his father eventually lead to the eureka moment where he realizes that Jupiter can be ignited, and the shockwave can propel the Earth away from Jupiter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to present the significance of the father in the son’s achievement, the film uses parallel editing to cut three scenes from different time and place together and creates an allusion of Liu Peiqiang helping Liu Qi save the planet. The three scenes are: Liu Qi standing on Earth and looking up at Jupiter, Liu Peiqiang staring at Jupiter from the space station, and a flashback to Liu Peiqiang lecturing Liu Qi about Jupiter when Liu Qi was young. Because the dialogue from the flashback is the only sound the audiences are hearing, the three scenes appear to be integrated as if Liu Peiqiang is actually talking to his son at this moment. The fact that Liu Qi is looking up into the sky and Liu Peiqiang is up in the space station also makes it seem like Liu Qi is looking up to his father, implying the authority of the father and significance of father’s guidance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the father-son dyad is one of the five relationships (五伦) in Confucianism, father-son identification is at the core of the Chinese kinship system (<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-0266-4_24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chan 393</a>). “The hierarchical patriarchal family is the model for all relationships”, including the relationship between an individual and the state (<a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/fq/article/74/1/40/111815/No-Father-and-Son-Reunion-Chinese-Sci-Fi-in-The" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Berry 42</a>). The state is usually being referred to as the father and the citizens as the children; citizens are expected to be loyal to the state just as children should obey their fathers. Thus, a Chinese father-son story can often be an allegory of one’s relationship with the state (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/9/3/94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhu 4</a>). In the film, Liu Qi goes through a transition from first being rebellious against his father to later understanding his father and inheriting his spirit of saving the planet, which not only affirms the authority of the father but also the authority of the state. Liu Peiqiang sacrificing himself and saving the Earth at the end of the film also reaffirms the greatness of the father. This sequentially implies “Chinese patriarchal masculinity as the subjectivity fit for a new century” (<a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/fq/article/74/1/40/111815/No-Father-and-Son-Reunion-Chinese-Sci-Fi-in-The" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Berry 41</a>). Therefore, the eventual father-son conciliation in the film reinforces the traditional Chinese patriarchal hierarchy and the government’s authority, promoting Chinese nationalism at the same time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The idea of “home” occurs numerous times throughout the movie, and it either refers to Beijing No.3 underground city where Liu Qi grows up in or our home planet, the Earth. The concept of “home” in the film is also arguably a metaphor for the state, and the concept of “going home” is a metaphor for one’s loyalty to the state. In addition to the significance of the concepts of home and homecoming in Chinese culture, there is a tight connection between home and state in Confucianism. In the <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Rites" target="_blank">Book of Rites</a></em> (礼记), one of the Confucian classics, there is famous saying that says, “If there is virtue in the man, there is order in the family. If there is order in the family, the country will be strong. If the country is strong, there will be peace in the world” (修身齐家治国平天下). In Chinese language, the word for country, Guojia (国家), is composed of two characters: Guo (国), meaning nation, and Jia (家), meaning home. This integration of family and nation carries on until these days. Xi Jinping, the President of People’s Republic of China, also stresses the importance of “vigorously promoting national and family feelings” (大力弘扬家国情怀) (<a href="https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/hsmet-19/125913710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lu 724</a>).</p>



<div class="is-layout-flex wp-container-12 wp-block-columns">
<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>Here are two examples of the film’s strategic use of the concept of “home” or “returning home” to hint at the underlying Confucian individual-state relation. Firstly, when the rescue team reaches Shanghai, which is the hometown of Han Ziang, who is Liu Qi’s grandfather, another father figure, Han Ziang reminisces about the good, old pre-apocalyptic days. He eventually dies sitting on a chair in a building, representing the notion of “returning to one’s origin” (落叶归根) in the Chinese traditional culture and hinting at the attachment to one’s home/state. </p>
</div>



<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:33.33%">
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="/dgah-capstone/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/images.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-249" width="345" height="134" srcset="/dgah-capstone/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/images.jpg 359w, /dgah-capstone/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/images-300x117.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Han Ziang dies in his hometown</figcaption></figure>
</div>
</div>



<p>After grandpa dies, Liu Qi’s sister, Han Duoduo, cries: “Grandpa is gone, where lies our home?” Here, the loss of the father figure is equal to the loss of home, implying the parallels between the father and the state and solidifying the government’s regime. Secondly, the film shows humans’ dedication to preserving the home planet by escaping the solar system with the Earth. Some Chinese audiences view the “wandering earth” plan as a manifestation of China’s distinctive family values from the west. A popular comment on Douban (Chinese version of IMDb) says: “<em>Earth is going to be destroyed.Hollywood: let’s build a spaceship and run away. The Wandering Earth: let’s build engines for the earth and escape with the home</em>” (<a href="https://bpr.berkeley.edu/2019/08/27/the-wandering-earth-and-the-new-chinese-nationalist-idea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gao</a>). Therefore, the film’s constant mention of homecoming not only arouses nostalgic emotion and identity recognition among the Chinese audience, but it is also implicative of one’s attachment to one’s country, hence reinforcing nationalist sentiments.&nbsp;</p>

</div>



<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>In addition, due to the film’s emphasis on patriarchal authority, it is obvious to see the weakening and the underdevelopment of female characters in <em>The Wandering Earth</em>. Although the film has numerous male heroes saving the planet, there are only two prominent female characters, Han Duoduo and Zhou Qian, and both of them exhibit behaviors at odds with that of the male protagonists, being portrayed as impediments of the male protagonists’ success. Throughout the movie, Han Duoduo’s is depicted as pampered and incompetent. When Liu Qi borrows the suits from Yige who worries that he will not return the suits, Han Duoduo whispers, “Aren’t you not coming back?” This leads to Yige’s suspicion of Liu Qi, forcing Liu Qi to cause a scene and escape. </p>
</div>
</div>



<div class="is-layout-flex wp-container-18 wp-block-columns">
<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>Similarly, despite being the only scientific female character in the film, Zhou Qian displays overemotional and impulsive behavior that seems out of character. When another team member collapses and dies, Zhou Qian has an emotional outburst and destroys the lighter core which sabotages the rescue mission led by Captain Wang Meng. These seemingly “foolish” behaviors “can’t make the audience feel the approval of any femininity”, and “the moments when the female images have the most sense of existence in the film happen to be when they are hysterical” (<a href="https://al-kindipublisher.com/index.php/ijllt/article/view/1217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ma and Hua 213</a>). Thus, it seems that one of the sole purposes of the female characters in this film is to contrast with the cleverness and the bravery of the male characters, underscoring the greatness of the patriarchal masculinities and in turn boosting the image of the state.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>GREAT UNITY AND COLLECTIVISM</strong></p>



<p>With the portrayals of the UEG and characters from various countries such as France, Indonesia, Russia, South Korea, and the United States, <em>The Wandering Earth</em> presents the audience with an imagined world where people of different cultures and languages work together harmoniously. The optimistic depiction of human’s collective strength starts from the beginning with the founding of a united government representative of the entire human race and its effective execution including the proposal of the “wandering earth” plan and the construction of thousands of engines around the globe. Throughout the film, there is little to no individual, heroic behavior. When faced with challenges, the main characters always work as a team, and sacrifices and deaths are prevalent. Some might argue that the sacrifice of Liu Peiqiang can be viewed as an act of individual heroism, it is potentially just another way of representing the collectivist idea that the needs and goals of the group as a whole weigh over the needs and desires of each individual (<a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-collectivistic-cultures-2794962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Understanding Collectivist Cultures”</a>). This is highly aligned with the CCP’s ideology of a “harmonious society” (和谐社会) where the overall social stability is emphasized over personal interest. It is arguably rooted in Confucianism as well where social harmony is greatly valued (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harmonious_Society&amp;oldid=1087508243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Harmonious Society”</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The depiction of human’s collective power seems to reach a climax when UEG allows the protagonists to do a global broadcast of their rescue plan at the end of the film. There is a scene where all the leaving rescue teams make a U-turn with their vehicles to go back and help the protagonist’s team, resulting in the eventual success of reigniting the engine. In addition to the fact that it seems implausible for all the rescue teams to change their minds and return to help the protagonists, it is physically unrealistic for all the huge vehicles to make a U-turn on a crowded road without causing any traffic congestion. This scene is an idealized portrayal of humans acting collectively in the time of crisis. These depictions of collective strength under Chinese leadership are symbolic of the idea that “threats to human survival can be controlled through disciplined collective labor” and “Chinese fantasies of hegemony” (<a href="https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/wandering-earth-gender-race-and-the-limits-of-imagination" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Viteri and Crane-Seeber</a>).</p>

<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>The notion of a united mankind is not a new concept in Chinese culture. In the <em>Book of Rites</em>, the “Great Unity” is used to describe an ideal society ruled by the public where everyone is virtuous and equal, and everything is at peace. The concept was later invoked by numerous modern Chinese politician such as Kang Youwei (康有为), Sun Yat-san (孙中山), and Mao Zedong (毛泽东) as the ultimate goal of human society (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Unity&amp;oldid=1061049038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Great Unity”</a>). In recent years, the concept of the “community of common destiny” is being promoted by the CCP as a showcase of China’s vision of future global governance, highly aligned with the traditional notion of the “Great Unity”. The concept is frequently cited by current General Secretary Xi Jinping (习近平) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Community_of_Common_Destiny&amp;oldid=1090487477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Community of Common Destiny”</a>). Xi’s famous global infrastructure development strategy, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Belt and Road Initiative</a> (一带一路), is a manifestation of this concept as he stated at the opening ceremony of the inaugural Belt and Road Forum, “moving closer towards a community of shared future for mankind is the ultimate goal of the Belt and Road initiative” (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/app5.231" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">D. Zhang 196-197</a>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the film’s presentation of Chinese leadership is in accordance with Xi’s goal of establishing China’s national image and the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” (中华民族的伟大复兴). In order to change the stereotypical image of China being backward or underdeveloped, the film includes Chinese elements in a lot of futuristic settings. For example, the film has a lot of shots on famous modern Chinese architecture such as the Shanghai Pearl Tower in ruins. The grandeur of the buildings even after the apocalypse gives the audience freedom to imagine the advanced urban development in contemporary China. The film also incorporates a lot of neon signs with Chinese characters in the Beijing No.3 underground city such as propaganda posters, road signs, and “串” (skewer), taking what are typical in a Chinese city and giving them a sense of modernity and technology.</p>

<p>The aesthetic choice of the film is also constantly reminding the audience of “China’s role as a valued member of the united coalition” by showing the Chinese flag right next to the logo of the UEG which appears very similar to the UN’s well-known emblem (<a href="https://sfrareview.org/2020/09/04/50-2-a13silk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silk</a>). Thus, <em>The Wandering Earth </em>attempts to exhibit China as a modern and technologically advanced nation, providing “a window for the world to have a new understanding of China” (<a href="https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/jahp-19/125917423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ye 153</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<div class="is-layout-flex wp-container-33 wp-block-columns">
<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%">
<p>The fact that the character, Liu Peiqiang, is played by the well-known Chinese character named Wu Jing (吴京), who is the main cast in a patriotic war action film called <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Warrior" target="_blank">Wolf Warrior </a> </em>(战狼), is also suggestive of the film’s intention to appeal to the ongoing wolf warrior culture in Chinese society and policy. Since the release of the two <em>Wolf Warrior </em>films which “highlight patriotic themes and the greatness of the Chinese nation”, people started to call those with heightened nationalist and patriotic sentiments “wolf warriors” on the internet (<a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7312/yang20046-010/html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yang 181</a>). Because the characters Wu Jing plays are both patriotic and competent in the two films, some critics of the nationalistic propaganda called <em>The Wandering Earth </em>“Wolf Warrior in Space” (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/9/3/94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhu 8</a>). The term, “wolf warrior diplomacy” (战狼外交), is also used to refer to Xi’s new foreign policy strategy, “Major Country Diplomacy” (大国外交), which is an aggressive style of diplomacy to exert China’s image as strong and authoritative (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wolf_warrior_diplomacy&amp;oldid=1088291754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Wolf Warrior Diplomacy”</a>). This attempt to strengthen China’s national image is part of Xi’s ambition to achieve the Chinese Dream and restore China’s “Golden Age” (盛世). Therefore, the movie specifically uses the character Wu Jing plays to evoke nationalist sentiments and the “inner pride” of the Chinese audience and “consolidate their patriotic enthusiasm” (<a href="http://journals.aiac.org.au/index.php/IJALEL/article/view/6600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xie 48</a>). This makes the film comply with Xi’s political ideologies and further solidifies the government’s rule.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
</div>
</div>



<div class="is-layout-flex wp-container-37 wp-block-columns">
<div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-column">
<p>By painting the father figure in a positive light and highlighting the achievements of a united humanity, <em>The Wandering Earth</em> envisions an idealized society where China becomes the leader of mankind. Its patriarchal narrative and emphasis on collectivism are not only deep-seated in traditional Confucian family values and the classical Chinese philosophy of the “Great Unity”, but they are also in harmony with the political ideologies currently promoted by the Chinese Communist Party. <em>The Wandering Earth</em>, along with many contemporary films with similar patriotic sentiments, is meeting the needs of the ongoing Chinese nationalist spirits and empowering the Chinese government.</p>

<p>The project titled &#8220;Hedeby Boat Chamber Grave: Reconstructed in 3D&#8221; is an endeavor led and developed by Austin Mason, a history and digital arts &amp; humanities professor at Carleton College. The primary objective of this project is to reconstruct the Hedeby boat chamber grave utilizing 3D modeling techniques for the landscape, tomb, and associated artifacts. </p>



<p>In my capacity as a contributor,  I wrote a summary of one of the artifacts in the grave and identified a suitable 3D model for it. The resulting article, along the others, has been documented on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hist.sites.carleton.edu/bootkammergrab/3d/glasbecher-bd?path=contents" target="_blank">catalog website</a>. Regrettably, the catalog website is not yet publicly accessible; therefore, a screenshot of my article is attached below.</p>
